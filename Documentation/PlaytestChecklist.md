# Manual Playtest Checklist

Run these on the Windows build downloaded from the latest green CI run. Automated tests cover the rules; this list covers what only a person can judge.

## Phase 1: one resident

1. **Start:** a new install opens to Rose Cottage with Mabel in bed. The panel on the right shows the day and time, her needs and "Recently".
2. **Clock:** time advances about one in-game minute per real second at 1x. Pause, 2x, 4x and 10x work from the buttons and from Space and keys 1–4.
3. **Morning routine:** within the first in-game hour she uses the toilet and cooks breakfast. The need bars rise while she does each activity.
4. **Walking and doors:** she walks tile by tile, never through walls, and leaves the cottage by the front door. The view switches to the village when she goes outside.
5. **Work:** on a weekday she goes to the community garden by about 08:30 and works until 17:00. If she gets very thirsty, she visits the garden tap and goes back to work.
6. **Evening and night:** after work she showers, eats and relaxes (reading, the park bench or the fitness corner). Around 22:30 she goes to bed and sleeps until about 06:30.
7. **Weekend:** on Saturday (day 6) she does not go to work.
8. **Viewing the other map:** Tab shows the other map and F returns to following her.
9. **Save and load:** press F5 at a recognisable moment, wait a few minutes, then press F9. She returns to the same place and activity, with the same need values.
10. **Exit and reopen:** close the window, then reopen the game. The town continues from where it was, and the status line says the saved town was loaded.
11. **Start over:** "Start over" asks for a second click, then begins a fresh town on day 1.
12. **Settings warning:** edit `TheTinyTown_Data/StreamingAssets/Configuration/settings.json` so the model is `""`. The panel still shows the default model, and `Player.log` contains a settings warning.

Saves are in `%USERPROFILE%\AppData\LocalLow\The Tiny Town\The Tiny Town\Saves\` (`town.json` plus `town.json.bak`).
